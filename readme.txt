This project involves the educational design and simulation of a two-stage Miller OTA, specifically tailored for beginners in the Analog Design track. Using the GF_180nm open-source technology PDK, the project introduces foundational concepts such as gm/ID design curves, gain bandwidth, and stability analysis. While it provides a solid starting point for new designers, some advanced specifications and layout considerations are simplified, as the primary focus is on building essential skills rather than creating an industrial-grade design.
